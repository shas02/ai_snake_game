# Snake AI with Deep Q-Learning

This project implements an AI agent that learns to play the classic Snake game using Deep Q-Learning with PyTorch.

## Model Description

The AI uses a simple neural network with two fully connected layers:

- **Input layer:** 11 features representing the current game state, including danger directions, current movement direction, and food location relative to the snake's head.
- **Hidden layer:** 256 neurons with ReLU activation.
- **Output layer:** 3 outputs representing possible actions â€” move straight, turn right, or turn left.

The model learns by interacting with the game environment, receiving rewards for eating food (+10), penalties for collisions (-10), and training its Q-values accordingly.
